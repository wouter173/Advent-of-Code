## Challenge 12
Advent of Code 2020

I was stuck on this challenge way too long.
The L operator didnt work and I lost my mind over it, thank you AoC.

Once again part 2 doesn't work and I have no idea why.
So you don't have to try running it. At this point I'm just not having enough time, energie and brain juice for AoC.

#### To run this challenge

```sh
python3 One.py #part one
```
