## Challenge 9
Advent of Code 2020

This challenge was litteraly dog shit, purely  because of this stupid fucking rule:
`
add together the smallest and largest number in this contiguous range;
`

I was adding the first and last values of the range ffs.
I realised this after testing [Netlob](https://github.com/Netlob)'s code, this is why I included his main.js in this challenge.


#### To run this challenge

```sh
python3 One.py #part one
python3 Two.py #part two

node main.js #Netlob's part one and two
```
